            <p>My name is Lee! I’m an illustrator and character designer by heart, but I am learning packaging design and enjoy working on motion as well. I love listening to music and playing Dungeons and Dragons with my friends. Right now I am playing a character named Zurah, who is a god in a pantheon based on human emotions (the pantheon is heavily based on Egyptian and Greek mythology).</p>

            <p>Speaking of, I have 6 tattoos, one being Anubis, another being a Sha hieroglyph, one being a moon that I have matching with my sister. The others are an album cover, a greyhound, and my first one, a piece of my childhood dog. </p>

            <p>Creative writing is a hobby of mine as well. I've been enjoying playing the Pokemon games ever since I was little, with my favorite games being Pokemon Black and Legends Arceus. I also have a partner of nearly 4 years, who I have been friends with since 2016, so we have known each other for a long time. That’s some basic information about me.</p>
